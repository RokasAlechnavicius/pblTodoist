This system is made for second semester of second year of study in Vilnius university and is based on Todoist project management system.
A user can register and create an account, add his Todoist API key.
The system then would sink itself with Todoist, creating visible projects and tasks of the user.
He could then see various additional information about the system in addition to being able to see the changes he does in Todoist itself.
In addition to that, data analysis and visualisation in charts is also in the system.
